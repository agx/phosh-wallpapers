  * Add phosh logo wallpaper.
    As per request in https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phosh/-/merge_requests/1294#note_1796767
  * wallpapers: Add install file.
    We'll add more packages so we need to specify what to install
  * Add initial plymouth theme.
    The (non logo) artwork is from the Mobian theme which in turn is based
    on the Librem 5 theme.
    To enable add
      "splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles"
    to the kernel's command line
